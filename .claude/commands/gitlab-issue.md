### 5. GitLab Issue Creation via MCP

**MCP Integration:**
```bash
# Use GitLab MCP tool for issue creation
mcp__gitlab__create_issue with parameters:
{
  "project_id": "current-project-id",
  "title": "$ARG2",
  "description": "generated-template-content",
  "labels": ["auto-assigned-labels"],
  "assignee_ids": [user-id],
  "milestone_id": milestone-id
}
```

### 6. Smart Label Assignment

**Automatic Labels Based on Type:**
```bash
case "$ARG1" in
    "bug")
        LABELS=("bug" "needs-investigation")
        TEMPLATE="bug_report"
        ;;
    "feature")
        LABELS=("feature" "enhancement" "needs-discussion")
        TEMPLATE="feature_request"
        ;;
    "infrastructure"|"infra")
        LABELS=("infrastructure" "terraform")
        TEMPLATE="infrastructure_issue"
        ;;
    "docs"|"documentation")
        LABELS=("documentation" "improvement")
        TEMPLATE="documentation_issue"
        ;;
    "security")
        LABELS=("security" "urgent")
        TEMPLATE="security_issue"
        ;;
esac
```

### 7. Issue Linking and References

**Automatic Linking:**
```bash
# Link to current branch if feature branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)
if [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH =~ ^feature/ ]]; then
    DESCRIPTION+="\n\nRelated branch: \`$CURRENT_BRANCH\`"
fi

# Link to recent commits
RECENT_COMMITS=$(git log --oneline -5)
DESCRIPTION+="\n\nRecent commits:\n\`\`\`\n$RECENT_COMMITS\n\`\`\`"

# Reference configuration files
if [ -f "terraform.auto.tfvars" ]; then
    DESCRIPTION+="\n\nRelevant config: terraform.auto.tfvars"
fi
```

### 8. Priority and Milestone Assignment

**Smart Priority Assignment:**
```bash
# Determine priority based on type and keywords
if [[ "$ARG3" =~ (critical|urgent|production|security) ]]; then
    PRIORITY="high"
    LABELS+=("urgent")
elif [[ "$ARG3" =~ (important|major|blocking) ]]; then
    PRIORITY="medium"
else
    PRIORITY="low"
fi

# Assign to current milestone
CURRENT_MILESTONE=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null | sed 's/v//')
if [ -n "$CURRENT_MILESTONE" ]; then
    # Get next milestone
    NEXT_VERSION=$(echo $CURRENT_MILESTONE | awk -F. '{$3++; print $1"."$2"."$3}')
    MILESTONE_ID="milestone-$NEXT_VERSION"
fi
```

### 9. Issue Validation and Enhancement

**Content Validation:**
```bash
# Ensure minimum issue quality
if [ ${#ARG2} -lt 10 ]; then
    echo "❌ Issue title too short (minimum 10 characters)"
    exit 1
fi

if [ ${#ARG3} -lt 50 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Consider adding more details to the description"
fi

# Check for sensitive information
if [[ "$ARG3" =~ (password|secret|key|token) ]]; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Issue may contain sensitive information"
    echo "Please review before creating"
fi
```

### 10. Post-Creation Actions

**Issue Information Display:**
```bash
echo "✅ GitLab Issue Created"
echo "Type: $ARG1"
echo "Title: $ARG2"
echo "URL: $ISSUE_URL"
echo "Labels: ${LABELS[*]}"
echo "Priority: $PRIORITY"
echo ""
echo "Next Steps:"
echo "- Review issue details and add additional context"
