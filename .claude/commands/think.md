## Thinking Framework

### Phase 1: Problem Framing

**Define the Core Question**

- What exactly are we trying to understand or solve?
- What assumptions are we making?
- What constraints and boundaries exist?
- What would success look like?

**Establish Context**

- Historical background and precedents
- Current state and influencing factors
- Stakeholder perspectives and interests
- Environmental and systemic considerations

### Phase 2: Multi-Angle Analysis

**First Principles Thinking**

- Break down to fundamental truths and building blocks
- Question basic assumptions and conventional wisdom
- Identify root causes vs. symptoms
- Reconstruct understanding from the ground up

**Systems Thinking**

- Map interconnections and feedback loops
- Identify emergent properties and side effects
- Consider second and third-order consequences
- Analyze system dynamics and behavior patterns

**Contrarian Perspective**

- What would the opposite approach look like?
- What are the strongest counterarguments?
- Where might conventional wisdom be wrong?
- What are the hidden downsides of popular solutions?

**Temporal Analysis**

- How has this problem/topic evolved over time?
- What are the current trends and trajectories?
- What might change in the short/medium/long term?
- How do time horizons affect the analysis?

**Stakeholder Viewpoints**

- How would different parties see this differently?
- What are their incentives and constraints?
- Where do interests align or conflict?
- What perspectives might be missing?

### Phase 3: Creative Exploration

**Analogical Thinking**

- How is this similar to problems in other domains?
- What can we learn from nature, history, or other fields?
- What metaphors or models might apply?
- How do other industries handle similar challenges?

**Scenario Planning**

- What are the best-case, worst-case, and most likely scenarios?
- What would happen if key assumptions changed?
- What external factors could significantly impact outcomes?
- How robust are potential solutions across scenarios?

**Inversion Thinking**

- What would failure look like, and how could we avoid it?
- What are we trying NOT to achieve?
- What would make this problem worse?
- How might we accidentally create new problems?

**Combinatorial Thinking**

- What happens if we combine different approaches?
- What new possibilities emerge from unexpected combinations?
- How might seemingly unrelated concepts connect?
- What novel solutions might exist at the intersections?

### Phase 4: Critical Evaluation

**Logical Consistency**

- Are the arguments internally consistent?
- Where might there be logical fallacies or gaps?
- What evidence supports or contradicts key claims?
- How strong are the causal relationships?

**Practical Feasibility**

- What are the real-world implementation challenges?
- What resources and capabilities would be required?
- What are the technical, financial, and organizational constraints?
- How would this work in practice, not just in theory?

**Risk Assessment**

- What could go wrong and how likely is it?
- What are the potential costs of failure?
- How reversible are the decisions?
- What contingency plans might be needed?

**Unintended Consequences**

- What second-order effects might emerge?
- How might the solution create new problems?
- What behaviors might be incentivized?
- How might the system adapt or respond?

### Phase 5: Synthesis and Insight Generation

**Pattern Recognition**

- What patterns emerge across different angles of analysis?
- Where do multiple perspectives converge?
- What themes or principles appear repeatedly?
- What unexpected connections were discovered?
