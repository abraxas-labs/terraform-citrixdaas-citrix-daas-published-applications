## Error Handling and Recovery

### Intelligent Error Recovery
```
Error Detection:
- MCP GitLab API failures
- Permission issues
- Conflict situations
- Network connectivity problems

Recovery Strategies:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Alternative workflow paths
- Graceful degradation
- User notification with actionable solutions

Fallback Mechanisms:
- Manual intervention guidance
- Partial workflow completion
- State preservation for retry
- Rollback to previous state
```

### Context-Aware Error Messages
```
Instead of: "API call failed"
Provide: "Cannot create branch 'feature/user-auth' - branch already exists.
         Options: 1) Use existing branch, 2) Create with suffix, 3) Delete and recreate"

Instead of: "Permission denied"
Provide: "Insufficient permissions to create branches in dimi4ik/devops_tf_templates.
         Contact repository owner or use fork workflow instead."
```

## Integration Points

### TodoWrite Integration
```

- Automatic branch cleanup after successful merge

Branch Naming Conventions:
- feature/[feature-name] - Feature development
- hotfix/[issue-description] - Critical fixes
- setup/[repo-name] - Repository setup
- sync/[sync-target] - Multi-repo sync
- issue/[issue-number] - Issue implementation
```

### CLAUDE.md Compliance
