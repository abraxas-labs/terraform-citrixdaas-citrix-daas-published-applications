## What Is This? (GUI vs. Code Comparison)

If you're a Citrix Administrator used to clicking through Citrix Studio, this module does the same thing‚Äîbut with code.

### The Traditional Way (Citrix Studio):
1. Log into Citrix Cloud
2. Open Citrix Studio
3. Navigate to Applications ‚Üí Create Application
4. Fill out the form (15-20 clicks):
   - Application Name
   - Published Name
   - Executable Path
   - Working Directory
   - Select Delivery Group
   - Set Folder
   - Configure Visibility (optional)
   - Add Icon (optional)
5. Click "Finish"
6. **Time**: ~5 minutes per application

<!-- SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Citrix Studio "Create Application" wizard -->

### The Automated Way (This Module):
1. Write a configuration file describing your application
2. Run `terraform apply`
3. **Time**: ~30 seconds per application (plus, you can deploy 100 apps as easily as 1)

**Result**: Same published application, same user experience‚Äîjust created with code.

**üìñ See detailed step-by-step instructions below**, starting with [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-what-you-need-before-starting).

---

## Why Should You Use This?

### Time Savings
| Task | Citrix Studio (Manual) | This Module (Automated) |
|------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 Published App | 5 minutes (15-20 clicks) | 30 seconds |
| 10 Published Apps | 50 minutes | 5 minutes |
| 100 Published Apps | 8+ hours | 15 minutes |

### Additional Benefits
- ‚úÖ **No Click Errors**: Configuration is validated before deployment
- ‚úÖ **Repeatable**: Deploy the same app to Dev/Test/Prod environments
- ‚úÖ **Version Control**: Track changes over time (who changed what, when)
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Your code IS your documentation
- ‚úÖ **Team Collaboration**: Share configurations, peer review changes
- ‚úÖ **Rollback**: Easily revert to previous configurations

---

### 2. Citrix Cloud API Credentials

You need API credentials to allow Terraform to connect to Citrix Cloud.

**Step-by-Step: Creating API Credentials**

1. **Log into Citrix Cloud**: [https://citrix.cloud.com](https://citrix.cloud.com)
2. **Navigate to API Access**:
   - Click "Identity and Access Management" (hamburger menu, top-left)
   - Select "API Access"
   <!-- SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Citrix Cloud ‚Üí Identity and Access Management ‚Üí API Access -->
3. **Create Secure Client**:
   - Click "Create Client"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Terraform Automation")
   - Click "Create"
4. **Save Your Credentials** (‚ö†Ô∏è Important!):
   - **Customer ID**: Copy this (example: `abc123xyz`)
   - **Client ID**: Copy this (example: `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`)
   - **Client Secret**: Copy this immediately‚Äîit's only shown once! (example: `xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx==`)
   <!-- SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: API credentials screen with redacted values highlighted -->

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning**: The Client Secret is only displayed once. If you lose it, you'll need to create new credentials.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```powershell
   # Open a NEW PowerShell window
   terraform --version
   # Should output: Terraform v1.13.3
   ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:**
- **"terraform: command not found"** ‚Üí You forgot to restart your PowerShell/Command Prompt window! Close and reopen it.
- **"The system cannot find the path specified"** ‚Üí Check if you added the correct path to the PATH environment variable (e.g., `C:\terraform\`).
- **Permission errors** ‚Üí Make sure you extracted the file to a folder where you have write permissions.

**Proxy Configuration (if needed):**
If your network requires a proxy server, set these environment variables:
```powershell
# Set proxy (replace x.x.x.x:8080 with your actual proxy)
$env:HTTP_PROXY="http://x.x.x.x:8080"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY="http://x.x.x.x:8080"

# If proxy requires authentication
$env:HTTP_PROXY="http://username:password@x.x.x.x:8080"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY="http://username:password@x.x.x.x:8080"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B: Chocolatey (Package Manager)</strong></summary>

**Best for:** Windows admins who already use Chocolatey for software management.

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Install with Chocolatey:**
   ```powershell
   # Run in PowerShell (as Administrator)
   choco install terraform
   ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   ```powershell
   terraform --version
   # Should output: Terraform v1.13.3
   ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:**
- **"terraform: command not found"** ‚Üí Chocolatey installation incomplete. Try closing and reopening PowerShell as Administrator.
- **"choco: command not found"** ‚Üí Chocolatey is not installed. Install it first from [chocolatey.org/install](https://chocolatey.org/install).

**Proxy Configuration (if needed):**
If your network requires a proxy server, set these environment variables:
```powershell
# Set proxy (replace x.x.x.x:8080 with your actual proxy)
$env:HTTP_PROXY="http://x.x.x.x:8080"
$env:HTTPS_PROXY="http://x.x.x.x:8080"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option C: WSL2 (For Advanced Users)</strong></summary>

**Best for:** Developers and power users who need Linux compatibility.

**Why WSL2?**
- Better compatibility with some Terraform tools
- Easier to follow Linux-based documentation
- Works seamlessly with Git and DevOps tools

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Install WSL2:**
   ```powershell
   # Run in PowerShell (as Administrator)
   wsl --install
   # Restart your computer when prompted
   ```
   [Official Microsoft WSL2 Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

2. **Install Terraform in WSL2:**
   ```bash
   # Open Ubuntu terminal (search "Ubuntu" in Start Menu)

   # Download Terraform 1.13.3
   wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.13.3/terraform_1.13.3_linux_amd64.zip

   # Unzip and install
   unzip terraform_1.13.3_linux_amd64.zip
   sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/

   # Verify installation
   terraform --version
   # Should output: Terraform v1.13.3
   ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:**
- **"bash: terraform: command not found"** ‚Üí The binary is not in your PATH. Did you run `sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/`?
- **"Permission denied"** ‚Üí You forgot to use `sudo` when moving the file. Re-run: `sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/`
- **WSL-specific:** If you're in WSL but terraform doesn't work, make sure you installed it inside WSL, not in Windows.

**Proxy Configuration (if needed):**
If your network requires a proxy server, set these environment variables:
```bash
# Set proxy (replace x.x.x.x:8080 with your actual proxy)
export HTTP_PROXY="http://x.x.x.x:8080"
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://x.x.x.x:8080"

# If proxy requires authentication
export HTTP_PROXY="http://username:password@x.x.x.x:8080"
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://username:password@x.x.x.x:8080"

## Getting Started: Your First Published Application

Let's create your first Citrix Published Application using Terraform. We'll publish the **Windows Calculator** as an example (just like you would in Citrix Studio).

### Step 1: Create Your Project Folder

```bash
# Create a directory for your Citrix automation project
mkdir my-citrix-apps
cd my-citrix-apps
```

---

### Step 2: Configure Citrix Connection

In this step, you'll create 3 files: `terraform.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `main.tf`.

**How to create files**:
- Open your favorite editor: **Notepad** (Windows), **nano** (Linux/WSL), **vi/vim**, or **VS Code**
- Copy the code blocks below and paste them into the corresponding files
- Save each file in your `my-citrix-apps` directory

---

#### File 1: `terraform.tf`

**What does this file do?**
This file establishes the connection to Citrix Cloud (like logging into Citrix Studio).

**GUI Equivalent**: Logging into Citrix Cloud with your credentials.

```hcl
# terraform.tf
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.2"
  required_providers {
    citrix = {
      source  = "citrix/citrix"
      version = "~> 1.0.13"
    }
  }
}

provider "citrix" {
  cvad_config = {
    customer_id   = var.citrix_customer_id      # ‚Üê Uses environment variable TF_VAR_customer_id
    client_id     = var.citrix_client_id        # ‚Üê Uses environment variable TF_VAR_client_id
    client_secret = var.citrix_client_secret    # ‚Üê Uses environment variable TF_VAR_client_secret
  }
}
```

---

#### File 2: `variables.tf`

**What does this file do?**
Defines the input variables for API credentials (without storing the actual values).

```hcl
# variables.tf
variable "citrix_customer_id" {
  description = "Citrix Cloud Customer ID"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "citrix_client_id" {
  description = "Citrix Cloud Client ID"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "citrix_client_secret" {
  description = "Citrix Cloud Client Secret"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

---

#### File 3: `main.tf`

**What does this file do?**
This file describes the Published Application you want to create (like filling out the "Create Application" form in Citrix Studio).

**GUI Equivalent**: The "Create Application" wizard in Citrix Studio.

```hcl
# main.tf
module "calculator" {
  source  = "abraxas-labs/citrix-daas-published-applications/citrixdaas"
  version = "=0.5.8"

  # ============================================
  # Application Identity
  # ============================================
  citrix_application_name           = "calculator-app"
  # ‚Üë Internal name (not visible to users)
  # GUI: "Application Name" field

  citrix_application_published_name = "Calculator"
  # ‚Üë Display name users see in Citrix Workspace
  # GUI: "Published Name" field

  citrix_application_description = "Windows Calculator Application"
  # ‚Üë Description shown to users
  # GUI: "Description" field

  # ============================================
  # Executable Configuration
  # ============================================
  citrix_application_command_line_executable = "C:\\Windows\\system32\\calc.exe"
  # ‚Üë Path to the .exe file on the VDA (Virtual Delivery Agent)
  # GUI: "Application Path" field

  citrix_application_command_line_arguments = "C:\\Windows\\system32\\"
  # ‚Üë Command line arguments (empty for Calculator)
  # GUI: "Command Line Arguments" field

  citrix_application_working_directory = "%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%"
  # ‚Üë Starting directory (user's home directory)
  # GUI: "Working Directory" field

  # ============================================
  # Citrix Organization
  # ============================================
  # citrix_application_folder_path = "Production"
  # ‚Üë OPTIONAL: Folder in Citrix Studio where app appears
  # GUI: "Folder" dropdown
  # - If specified: Folder MUST exist in Citrix Cloud
  # - If omitted (or set to null): App will be created in root folder
  # Example: citrix_application_folder_path = null  # creates in root

  citrix_deliverygroup_name = "YOUR-DELIVERY-GROUP-NAME"
  # ‚Üë ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You MUST change this value! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
  #
  # BEFORE running terraform plan/apply:
  # 1. Open Citrix Cloud ‚Üí Studio ‚Üí Delivery Groups
  # 2. Copy the EXACT name (case-sensitive!) from the list
  # 3. Replace "YOUR-DELIVERY-GROUP-NAME" with that exact name
  #
  # Examples of CORRECT format:
  #   ‚úÖ "Production-DG"
  #   ‚úÖ "Test-Windows-DG"
  #
  # Common mistakes to AVOID:
  #   ‚ùå Typos: "Production-DG" vs. "Produktion-DG"
  #   ‚ùå Wrong case: "production-dg" vs. "Production-DG"
  #   ‚ùå Forgetting to change: "YOUR-DELIVERY-GROUP-NAME"
  #
  # GUI: "Delivery Group" dropdown
  # ‚ö†Ô∏è This Delivery Group MUST exist in Citrix Cloud
}
```

**‚úÖ File Creation Summary**:

You should now have 3 files in your `my-citrix-apps` directory:
```
my-citrix-apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tf     (Citrix provider configuration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf     (Variable definitions)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf          (Application definition)
```

**How Terraform reads credentials**:
- Terraform automatically reads environment variables starting with `TF_VAR_`
- You'll set these credentials in **Step 4** before deploying your application
- This keeps credentials secure and out of your code

---

### Step 3: Field Mapping Reference

Here's how Terraform variables map to Citrix Studio fields:

| Citrix Studio Field | Terraform Variable | Example Value |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Application Name | `citrix_application_name` | `"calculator-app"` |
| Published Name | `citrix_application_published_name` | `"Calculator"` |
| Description | `citrix_application_description` | `"Windows Calculator"` |
| Application Path | `citrix_application_command_line_executable` | `"C:\\Windows\\system32\\calc.exe"` |
| Command Line Arguments | `citrix_application_command_line_arguments` | `""` |
| Working Directory | `citrix_application_working_directory` | `"%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%"` |
| Folder (Optional) | `citrix_application_folder_path` | `"Production"` or `null` (root) |
| Delivery Group | `citrix_deliverygroup_name` | `"Production-DG"` |

---

### Step 4: Set API Credentials

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Set credentials BEFORE running Terraform commands!**

After creating your API credentials in Citrix Cloud (Prerequisites Step 2), you must store them securely as **environment variables**. Terraform will automatically read these variables when you run `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`.

**Why use environment variables?**
- ‚úÖ Credentials never appear in code or Git history
- ‚úÖ Easy to rotate/update without changing code
- ‚úÖ Different credentials per environment (Dev/Test/Prod)
- ‚úÖ Industry standard security practice

---

**For Linux/WSL Users**:

Open your terminal and set the credentials as environment variables:

```bash
# Set Citrix API credentials as environment variables
export TF_VAR_citrix_customer_id="your-customer-id-here"
export TF_VAR_citrix_client_id="your-client-id-here"
export TF_VAR_citrix_client_secret="your-client-secret-here"

# Verify they're set (optional)
echo $TF_VAR_citrix_customer_id
```

---

**For Windows PowerShell Users**:

Open PowerShell and set the credentials:

```powershell
# Set Citrix API credentials as environment variables
$env:TF_VAR_citrix_customer_id="your-customer-id-here"
$env:TF_VAR_citrix_client_id="your-client-id-here"
$env:TF_VAR_citrix_client_secret="your-client-secret-here"

# Verify they're set (optional)
echo $env:TF_VAR_citrix_customer_id
```

---

**For macOS Users**:

```bash
# Set Citrix API credentials as environment variables (same as Linux)
export TF_VAR_citrix_customer_id="your-customer-id-here"
export TF_VAR_citrix_client_id="your-client-id-here"
export TF_VAR_citrix_client_secret="your-client-secret-here"

# Verify they're set (optional)
echo $TF_VAR_citrix_customer_id
```

---

> **Note**: These environment variables are temporary and only last for the current terminal session. For permanent storage, you can add them to:
> - **Linux/WSL/macOS**: `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`
> - **Windows**: System Environment Variables (Start ‚Üí "Environment Variables")

**‚úÖ Credentials are now set!** You can proceed to deploy your application.

---

### Step 4.5: Avoid the #1 Beginner Mistake!

**‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE running `terraform plan` - Complete this checkpoint!**

The most common error for Terraform beginners is using an incorrect Delivery Group name. Let's prevent this before it happens:

#### Checkpoint: Delivery Group Name Verification

**Follow these steps IN ORDER:**

1. **Open Citrix Cloud in your browser:**
   - Go to [https://citrix.cloud.com](https://citrix.cloud.com)
   - Navigate to: **Studio ‚Üí Delivery Groups**

<!-- SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Citrix Studio showing Delivery Groups list with names highlighted -->

2. **Find your Delivery Group:**
   - Look at the list of Delivery Groups
   - Choose the one you want to use for this application
   - **Copy the name EXACTLY** (right-click ‚Üí Copy, or select and Ctrl+C)

3. **Update your `main.tf` file:**
   - Open `main.tf` in your text editor
   - Find line 391: `citrix_deliverygroup_name = "YOUR-DELIVERY-GROUP-NAME"`
   - **Paste** the exact name you just copied (replace `"YOUR-DELIVERY-GROUP-NAME"`)
   - **Save the file** (Ctrl+S)

4. **Double-check (IMPORTANT!):**
   ```bash
   # View the line to verify it's correct
   grep citrix_deliverygroup_name main.tf

   # Expected output example:
   #   citrix_deliverygroup_name = "Production-Windows-DG"
   ```

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ‚ùå WRONG | ‚úÖ CORRECT | Why It Fails |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| `"production-dg"` | `"Production-DG"` | Case mismatch (lowercase vs. uppercase) |
| `"Production-DG "` | `"Production-DG"` | Extra space at the end |
| `"YOUR-DELIVERY-GROUP-NAME"` | `"Production-DG"` | Forgot to replace placeholder |
| `"Prod-DG"` | `"Production-DG"` | Typo/abbreviation doesn't match |

#### What Happens If You Skip This?

You'll see this error when running `terraform plan`:

```
Error: Delivery Group "YOUR-DELIVERY-GROUP-NAME" not found

  with data.citrix_delivery_group.this,
  on main.tf line 17, in data "citrix_delivery_group" "this":
  17: data "citrix_delivery_group" "this" {
```

**To fix:** Come back to this checkpoint and follow the steps above.

### Step 5: Deploy Your Application

Now let's deploy the application to Citrix Cloud using the command line.

**Open your terminal/command line** (use the SAME terminal where you set environment variables in Step 4):
- **Windows (WSL)**: Open "Ubuntu" from Start Menu
- **Windows (Native)**: Open "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell"
- **macOS**: Open "Terminal" (Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Terminal)
- **Linux**: Open your terminal application

**Navigate to your project folder**:
```bash
cd my-citrix-apps
```

**Run the following Terraform commands**:

#### Command 1: Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```
**What happens?** Terraform downloads the Citrix provider and this module from the Terraform Registry.

**Expected Output**:
```
Initializing modules...
Downloading abraxas-labs/citrix-daas-published-applications/citrixdaas...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

<!-- SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: terraform init output -->

---

#### Command 2: Preview Changes (Dry Run)
```bash
terraform plan
```
**What happens?** Terraform shows you exactly what will be created‚Äîlike a "preview" or "dry run". **NOTHING is created yet!**

**Expected Output**:
```
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Read this output carefully!** It shows you what Terraform will create.

<!-- SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: terraform plan output showing the application to be created -->

---

#### Command 3: Apply Changes (Deploy to Citrix Cloud)
```bash
terraform apply
```
**What happens?** Terraform creates the Published Application in Citrix Cloud.

**Confirmation Required**: Terraform asks: `Do you want to perform these actions?`
- Type **`yes`** and press **Enter**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Only after you type `yes` will Terraform make changes to Citrix Cloud.

<!-- SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: terraform apply confirmation prompt -->

---

#### Command 4: Destroy Application (Optional)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Use this only if you want to delete the application from Citrix Cloud**

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**What happens?** Terraform deletes the Published Application from Citrix Cloud.

**Confirmation Required**: Terraform asks: `Do you really want to destroy all resources?`
- Type **`yes`** and press **Enter** to confirm deletion
- Type **`no`** or press **Ctrl+C** to cancel

**Expected Output**:
```
Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
```

**When to use this**:
- Testing: Clean up test applications after learning
- Mistakes: Remove incorrectly configured applications
- Cleanup: Delete applications you no longer need

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This permanently deletes the application. Make sure you selected the correct application before confirming!

---

### Step 6: Verify in Citrix Cloud

1. Log into **Citrix Cloud**: [https://citrix.cloud.com](https://citrix.cloud.com)
2. Navigate to: **Studio ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Production** (your folder)
3. ‚úÖ You should see **"Calculator"** in the list

<!-- SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Citrix Studio showing the newly created Calculator application -->

**Congratulations!** üéâ You've just created your first Published Application using Terraform.

## Troubleshooting for Beginners

### Common Errors and Solutions

| Error Message | What It Means | Solution |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `Error: Error reading Delivery Group YOUR-DELIVERY-GROUP-NAME`<br>or<br>`Error: Object does not exist` | **MOST COMMON ERROR #1:** You forgot to replace `"YOUR-DELIVERY-GROUP-NAME"` with your actual Delivery Group name | **Quick fix:**<br>1. Open Citrix Cloud ‚Üí Studio ‚Üí Delivery Groups<br>2. Copy the EXACT name from the list<br>3. Open your `main.tf` file<br>4. Find the line with `citrix_deliverygroup_name = "YOUR-DELIVERY-GROUP-NAME"`<br>5. Replace with your copied name: `citrix_deliverygroup_name = "Production-DG"`<br>6. Save and re-run `terraform plan`<br><br>**See Step 4.5 for detailed instructions** |
| `Error: Error reading Delivery Group [YourName]`<br>(with actual name) | **MOST COMMON ERROR #2:** The Delivery Group name has a typo or wrong case | **Step-by-step fix:**<br>1. Check the error message - what name did Terraform try?<br>2. Open Citrix Cloud ‚Üí Studio ‚Üí Delivery Groups<br>3. Compare: Is your name EXACTLY the same? (case-sensitive!)<br>4. Copy the correct name from Studio<br>5. Update `citrix_deliverygroup_name` in your module call<br>6. Save and re-run `terraform plan`<br><br>**Example:**<br>‚ùå WRONG: `"production-dg"` vs. `"Production-DG"`<br>‚úÖ CORRECT: Exact copy from Studio |
| `Error: Invalid API credentials` / `Unknown Citrix API Client Id` | Customer ID, Client ID, or Secret is incorrect or not set | 1. Verify environment variables are set (Step 4)<br>2. Check Citrix Cloud ‚Üí API Access<br>3. Create new credentials if needed |
| `Error: Application folder path "Production" not found` | The specified folder doesn't exist in Citrix Studio | **Option 1 - Create folder:**<br>1. Open Citrix Studio ‚Üí Applications<br>2. Create the folder "Production"<br>3. Re-run `terraform apply`<br><br>**Option 2 - Use root folder:**<br>1. Remove the line `citrix_application_folder_path = "Production"`<br>2. Or set it to `null`<br>3. Re-run `terraform apply` |
| `Error: Failed to query provider` | Citrix provider version issue | Run `terraform init -upgrade` |
| `Error: citrix_application_command_line_executable: invalid value` | Executable path has invalid format | Use double backslashes: `C:\\Windows\\system32\\calc.exe` |

<!-- SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: Example error output in terminal with solution highlighted -->

### Validation Workflow (Before Deploying)

Always run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Format your code (fixes indentation/spacing)
terraform fmt

# 2. Validate syntax (checks for errors)
terraform validate

# 3. Preview changes (see what will be created)
terraform plan

# 4. Only then: Apply changes
terraform apply
```

## Next Steps: Becoming More Advanced

### 1. Explore Advanced Examples

See real-world scenarios including:
- **Visibility Restrictions**: Limit apps to specific AD groups/users
- **Custom Icons**: Brand applications with company logos
- **Bulk Deployment**: Deploy 10+ applications simultaneously
- **Multi-Environment**: Manage Dev/Test/Prod with workspaces

**üëâ [View Advanced Examples](EXAMPLES.md)**

---

### 2. Learn Git Basics (Version Control)
Track your Terraform configurations over time:
- [Git for Beginners](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
- Why? Rollback changes, collaborate with team, audit trail

---

### 3. Best Practices for Citrix Admins
- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming (e.g., `app-name-environment`)
- **Folder Structure**: Organize by environment (Dev/Test/Prod) or department
- **Testing**: Always test in a non-production Delivery Group first
- **Documentation**: Comment your code (future you will thank you!)

---

### 4. Advanced Terraform Concepts (Optional)
- **Workspaces**: Manage multiple environments (Dev/Test/Prod)
- **Modules**: Create reusable configurations for your organization
- **Remote State**: Store Terraform state in Azure Storage or AWS S3

## FAQ for Citrix Administrators

### Q: Does this replace Citrix Studio?
**A**: No. Citrix Studio is still essential for:
- Monitoring sessions
- Troubleshooting user issues
- Viewing real-time performance
- Managing VDAs and Machine Catalogs

This module automates **application creation/management only**‚Äîit doesn't replace Studio.

---

### Q: Can I manage existing applications created in Studio?
**A**: Yes, but you need to **import** them into Terraform first:
```bash
terraform import module.calculator.citrix_application.published_application <application-id>
```
[Terraform Import Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/import/index.html)

---

### Q: What happens if I change an app in Studio after creating it with Terraform?
**A**: Terraform detects "drift" (differences between your code and reality).
When you run `terraform plan`, it shows:
- What you have in Studio (actual state)
- What your code defines (desired state)
- What changes Terraform will make to reconcile them

**Best Practice**: Make all changes in Terraform code, not in Studio (to avoid drift).

---

### Q: Can I delete applications with Terraform?
**A**: Yes. Remove the `module` block from `main.tf`, then run:
```bash
terraform apply
```
Terraform will ask: `Do you want to destroy these resources?`

---

### Q: What if I make a mistake in my code?
**A**:
1. **Before `terraform apply`**: Just fix the code and re-run `terraform plan`
2. **After `terraform apply`**: Fix the code and run `terraform apply` again (Terraform updates the resource)
3. **Worst case**: Delete the application in Studio, fix the code, re-apply

---

### Q: Is this safe to use in production?
**A**: Yes, if you follow the validation workflow:
1. Always run `terraform plan` first
2. Review the output carefully
3. Test in a non-production environment first
4. Use version control (Git) to track changes

---

### Q: Do I need to be a developer to use this?
**A**: No! If you can:
- Fill out forms in Citrix Studio
- Copy/paste text
- Follow step-by-step instructions

...you can use this module. The examples are designed for Citrix Admins, not developers.
